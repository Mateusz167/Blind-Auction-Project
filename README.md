# Blind-Auction-Project

## Blind Auction Program
Welcome to the Blind Auction Program! This project is designed to simulate a blind auction, where participants submit their bids without knowing the bids of others. This ReadMe file will guide you through the purpose, setup, and structure of the program. One of the primary purposes of this project is to facilitate learning about Python programming, file handling, and auction mechanics.

## Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:

- To simulate a blind auction where participants can submit bids without knowing others' bids.
- To provide a practical example for learning Python programming concepts such as input/output, loops, and data structures.
- To demonstrate the use of external libraries and modules for creating art and visualizations.

  ## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

main.py: The main script that runs the auction.
art.py: A module for generating ASCII art used in the program.
auction_flowchart.drawio: A flowchart created in draw.io to visualize the auction process.

## Files Overview
main.py
This is the main script that handles the auction process. It includes:
- Collecting bids from participants.
- Determining the highest bid.
- Announcing the winner.
  
art.py
This module contains functions to generate and display ASCII art for the program. It is used to enhance the visual appeal of the auction interface.

auction_flowchart.drawio
This file is a flowchart created in draw.io, visualizing the flow of the auction process. It helps in understanding the logic and structure of the program.
